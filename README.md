# UTA Student Affairs Websites
<h2>Hey, there! The following are the links to the website I built for the Department of Student Affairs at UTA</h2>
The websites are a part of the web modernization project, which is building responsive, aesthetic, and pixel-perfect websites for UTA. I worked as a web developer working mostly on developing the front end. I also worked on API services provided by UTA events to get data and present it using JavaScript. Good communication played a key role in the efficient sharing of ideas between each department head and the web team, as most communication was online I believe this role prepared me to accept changes that are uncomfortable but required for the betterment of all. 

The links to the live websites are as followed:
